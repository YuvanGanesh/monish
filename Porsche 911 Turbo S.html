        <p>Introduced in March 2020, the 992 Turbo S has a twin-turbocharged 3.7-litre flat-6 engine rated at 478 kW (641 hp; 650 PS) and 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft) of torque.[21] The engine is based on the 3.0 litre unit found in the Carrera models and has a slightly shorter stroke than that of the outgoing Turbo S engine. The compression ratio has also decreased to 8.7:1. The car can accelerate to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.4 seconds (3.0 seconds for the convertible), to 200 km/h (124 mph) in 8 seconds, and has a top speed of 330 km/h (205 mph). Both the turbochargers and the air intake system are larger, with the latter now being located directly behind the engine instead of in the rear fenders as on previous 911 Turbo models. The rear fenders now house the air filters instead. Two new factory options are available: Active Suspension Management and a sport exhaust. Standard equipment includes Porsche dynamic chassis control (PDCC), rear-axle steering and ceramic composite brakes. The front now has adaptive cooling flaps, while the rear wing is larger and generates 15 percent more downforce than the previous model. Active anti-rollbars, adaptive dampers and rear wheel steering are standard features.[22][23] In July 2020, the Turbo variant was introduced. It has the same twin turbocharged 3.7-litre flat-6 engine, detuned to 427 kW (573 hp; 581 PS) and 750 N⋅m (553 lb⋅ft). In a test conducted by Sport Auto on 30th January 2021, the 992 Turbo S lapped the Nürburgring Nordschleife in 7:17.3 minutes which made it the fastest road-legal production vehicle to lap the racetrack without using semi-slick tires.[24][25]</p>
