    <p>The Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG (C197 / R197) is a front mid-engine, 2-seater, limited production grand tourer developed by the Mercedes-AMG division of German automotive manufacturer Mercedes-Benz, with the assistance of David Coulthard.[4] The car is the successor to the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren and was described by Mercedes-Benz as a spiritual successor to the Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing, mainly because it was inspired by the latter.[5] SLS stands for "Super Leicht Sport" (Super Light Sport).</p>
    <br />
    <p>The SLS was the first Mercedes-Benz automobile designed and built from scratch entirely by AMG.[6] Upon its introduction at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show, the SLS AMG's 571 PS (420 kW; 563 hp) M159 engine was according to AMG "the world's most powerful naturally aspirated production series engine" ever produced.[7]</p>
    <br />
    <p>An electric version of the car, the SLS AMG Electric Drive, was presented at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. Production ended in 2014 with the introduction of the SLS AMG GT Final Edition.[8]</p>
    <br />
    <p>As compared to its predecessor (the Mercedes-McLaren SLR), the SLS is per Mercedes-AMG head Tobias Moers, the faster car on the track, both in the hands of normal drivers as well as race car drivers.[9] The Mercedes-McLaren SLR came in at 1,750 kg (3,858 lb).[10] The SLS, however, has a curb weight of 1,619 kg (3,569 lb) when equipped with the standard wheels.</p>
