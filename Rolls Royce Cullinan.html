        <p>The Rolls-Royce Cullinan is a full-sized luxury sport utility vehicle (SUV) manufactured by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars as the brand's first all-wheel drive vehicle.[4] It is named after the Cullinan Diamond, the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever discovered.[4]</p>
        <br />
        <p>The Cullinan sits above the Ghost and below the Phantom in Rolls-Royce's line,[5] with a starting price in the United States of approximately US$325,000 (Â£255,000).[4][6] It was unveiled in May 2018 at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este.[7] In the US, it is not exempt from the Energy Tax Act because it is classified as a station wagon rather than an SUV.</p>
