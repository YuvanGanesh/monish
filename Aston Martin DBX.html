        <p>The DBX is the first car made at Aston Martin's new facility in St Athan, Wales. According to executive vice president and chief creative officer Marek Reichman, the wheelbase of the DBX stretches as far out as possible for the wheels to be positioned at the corners of the vehicle, which, with the low roofline, creates the illusion of a smaller car, helping make the DBX appear more like a traditional Aston Martin shape. The DBX features swan-hinged doors, while the front grille is the largest ever fitted on an Aston Martin.[10] It has been described by the BBC and the Daily Telegraph as the "first full-size five-seater" model that Aston Martin has sold.[1][11] Sources outside the UK have described it as a "mid-sized crossover".[12][13][14][15]</p>
