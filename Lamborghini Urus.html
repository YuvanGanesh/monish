It was introduced in December 2017 as a 2018 model year production vehicle.[4] The Urus is the first Lamborghini SUV and five-door vehicle in the modern era (under the ownership of Volkswagen Group), and the second SUV in the brand's history after the LM002, which was produced between 1986 and 1993.</p>
