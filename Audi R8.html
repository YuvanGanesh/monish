        <p>The Audi R8 is a mid-engine, 2-seater sports car,[2][3] which uses Audi's trademark quattro permanent all-wheel drive system.[2] It was introduced by the German car manufacturer Audi AG in 2006. Production was supposed to end in 2023, [4] but was extended due to high demand. [38]</p>
        <br />
        <p>The car is exclusively designed, developed, and manufactured by Audi AG's private subsidiary company manufacturing high performance automotive parts, Audi Sport GmbH (formerly quattro GmbH),[5] and is based on the Lamborghini Gallardo and presently the Hurac√°n platform.[6] The fundamental construction of the R8 is based on the Audi Space Frame,[2] and uses an aluminium monocoque which is built using space frame principles. The car is built by Audi Sport GmbH in a newly renovated factory at Audi's 'aluminium site' at Neckarsulm in Germany.[2] It is also the first production car with full-LED headlamps.[7]</p>
